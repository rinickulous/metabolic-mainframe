# metabolic-mainframe
The First Hobbyist Bio-Computer

About
The need:
There is a need for an accessible synthetic biology platform. Currently, people are limited by expensive equipment and reagents, long Design-Build-Test-Learn cycles and paywalled research papers. Necessary reagents of purified enzymes are often proprietary and require a cold chain (-80 C), and many experimental workflows require high-speed centrifugation. Most of the hardware needed for wet-lab work is prohibitively expensive and DNA libraries are expensive to acquire and often difficult to use.
 
The solution: 
An open source “metabolic mainframe” which allows DIYBiologists to tinker at home. 
Important reagents can be freeze-dried and stored at room temperature for long periods, then re-hydrated for use. Instead of transforming DNA constructs into cells, “biochemical breadboards” (cell-free lysates) are now commonly used to rapidly test pathways. Open source hardware projects can cut equipment costs down 2-50x and projects such as FreeGenes are making needed sequences freely available to all. A “metabolic mainframe”, similar to the Arduino or Altair 8800, will grow an ecosystem which is decentralized, hacker-friendly and freely shares scientific results.
